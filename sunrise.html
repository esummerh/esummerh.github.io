          <h1>Capstone Project - Sunrise</h1>
          <p>
            <em>Sunrise</em> is a trauma-informed mobile application designed to
            support individuals navigating experiences of violence, abuse, or
            personal crisis. Built with privacy, discretion, and emotional
            safety at its core, the app includes secure journaling, anonymous
            support forums, emergency contact access, and curated resource
            directories—all integrated into a calming, non-intrusive interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developed during a senior capstone course at the University of
            Michigan, <em>Sunrise</em> was created by a cross-disciplinary team
            of five students with backgrounds in computer science, user
            experience design, and trauma-informed research. Our team
            collaborated using tools like Figma, Jira, GitHub, and Xcode to
            plan, prototype, and implement the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the semester, we focused on creating a digital space that
            prioritizes safety, empowerment, and usability. Every feature was
            thoughtfully designed and tested with a strong emphasis on
            accessibility, anonymity, and intuitive interaction—ensuring
            <em>Sunrise</em> meets the needs of users in vulnerable situations.

            <h3>Discreet Interface</h3>
            <p>
              <em>Sunrise</em> is intentionally designed to protect the user's
              privacy and safety. Its interface is intentionally subtle, with no
              overt reference to abuse, violence, or trauma. This ensures that
              even if someone glances at the screen, they won't be able to infer
              the app's true intent - making it safe to use in sensitive or
              dangerous environments.
